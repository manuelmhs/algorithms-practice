------ Frog - River: ------

A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is currently located at position 0, and wants to get to position X.
Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river. You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array arr[] consisting of N integers representing the falling
leaves. arr[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds. The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to
position X. The frog can jump J positions far. The leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.

For example, you are given integer X = 5, J = 1 and array arr such that: 
A[0] = 1 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 1 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 2 A[5] = 3 A[6] = 5 A[7] = 4

In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river,
and the frog can jump to position X (5).

Write a function that returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river which is X wide.
If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return âˆ’1.

If A[i] = -1, that means the ith leaf never fell.

# answer is the last index achieved when we fill the aux arr.
